# ScienceScraper
## By Dan Smith

This is a webscraper aimed at tracking content from [NASA's press release page!](https://www.nasa.gov/content/science-mission-directorate-press-releases)

The app lets the user scrape that day's articles, store them in a database, then add notes to articles in order to review them later. 

### Node Packages used:
* express 
* handlebars 
* logger 
* mongoose 
* axios 
* cheerio 

This app is also deployed live on heroku, and requires an addon to facilitate Mongodb.

At the time of writing (10/9/2019) the live application is still underway, but is continuing to be worked on.
